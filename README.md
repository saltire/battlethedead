# Battle the Dead
A spooky rail shooter where you aim with a Battleship grid.

This was a last-day crunch for Ludum Dare 41. The theme: Combine 2 Incompatible Genres.

I got in maybe eight hours of work on it. Very, very unfinished! ðŸ˜œ

What's here:
- Spooky monsters! Ooooo!
- Type A-J, then 1-0 to aim your shot.
- Type R to reload ammo.
- Zap them zombies! You may need to hit them more than once, depending on your aim.

What's not:
- More monsters.
- Monsters attacking, leaving big red slashes across the screen.
- Blood decals when hitting monsters.
- Player health and game over.
- Reload that takes time instead of being instant.
- Scoring.
- Sound.

Still, pretty fun way to spend a Sunday.
